# TIL
> Today I Learned

This is a my TIL repository. 
It contains write-ups and code snippets of small things I come across and learn on a day to day basis, covering a wide range of technologies and languages. 

This repo is inspired by [simonw til](https://github.com/simonw/til) and [jbranchaud til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)
